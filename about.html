<h4>Who are we?</h4>
<p>We are a start-up initiative of young passionate professionals and highly talented university students who have the passion and drive for impacting on the coming general with skills in science technology and engineering. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional formal education and real life workable skill acquisition. We aim to provide school students with practical experiments and technical designs to help them possess skills to thrive in our ever advancing community. </p>

<h4> What we offer? </h4>
<p>We conduct practical sessions with student aged 7 to 17, focusing on STEM innovation. Examples of our projects are: constructing an alarm system, designing and building robotic cars, constructing a robotic arm etc. Our sessions run for a duration of 2 hour to 3 hour 30 mins  for approximately 74  hrs and could be spread across 2/3 academic terms with 6 â€“ 9 hours each terms.
</p>

<h4> Flexible option for your students</h4>
<p class="mb-5">We love designing and inventing different things to solve the economic issues and/or just for being innovative. We believe the young students deserve the best the country has to offer to prepare them for the future by equipping them with the right set of skills and technical knowhow to complement their formal education to give them the tools to compete with the best the world. The value we are able to bring in our school-based programs is simply unparalleled, and your students will receive prep that will help them integrate easily into the ever advancing technically oriented society. We understand school schedules are often tight, so our plans are designed to place very little strain on the school curriculum. </p>


<h4> Benefits Of School Based prep </h4>
<p>There are several specific benefits of our school-based programs, both for students and for the school itself. Students benefit because they are simply used to learning at school. This makes for a natural environment for learning something different and partial which can be developed and later translated into real life, and students often approach these programs with an enthusiastic attitude. In addition, school is often regarded as conventional to many with a traditional learning routine. Our programs would help to add some excitement to what the students can achieve at school. Our programs can raise average learning of a student and the pedigree of a school by proudly showcasing the practical achievements of their students through our program. These are goals every school should have, and our programs are a quick, free way of improving these metrics.  Our instructors are motivated, highly skilled individuals, very good at what they do and have a strong desire to impact the upcoming generation with the knowledge. </p>
